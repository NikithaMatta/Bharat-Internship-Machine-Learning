# Bharat-Internship-Machine-Learning
This GitHub repository showcases the projects I've created during my Bharat Internship.

Project 01: House Price Prediction

1. Objective: Predict house prices based on relevant features.
2. Tools/Libraries Used:
 Python;
 Scikit-learn (for machine learning algorithms);
 TensorFlow (for neural networks); and
 Pandas (for data manipulation).
3. Data Collection: Gather a dataset with house-related features and prices.
4. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, and outliers, and normalize/scale numerical features.
5. Feature Selection: Choose relevant features for prediction using the method of correlation analysis
6. Split Data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
7. Algorithms:
Linear Regression for simplicity;
Decision Trees for capturing complex relationships;
Random Forest for improved accuracy; and
Neural Networks (using TensorFlow) for intricate patterns.
8. Train Models: Train each selected algorithm on the training dataset.
9. Evaluate Models: Use metrics like Mean Squared Error to assess the models' performance on the test dataset.
10. Predictions: Make predictions on new data using the trained models.
11. Outcome: A predictive model for house prices that can be used for future predictions.


Project 03: Iris Flower Classification
1. Objective: Classify iris flowers into species based on their features.
2. Tools/Libraries Used:
 Python;
 Scikit-learn (for machine learning algorithms);
 Pandas (for data manipulation); and
 Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization).
3. Dataset: Utilize the famous Iris dataset containing sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
4. Data Exploration: Understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.
5. Data Preprocessing: Handle any missing values and ensure data quality.
6. Data Visualization: Plot graphs to visualize relationships between features and species.
7. Split Data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
8. Algorithms:
Kth Nearest Neighbour;
Decision Trees;
Support Vector Machine; and
Random Forest.
9. Train Models: Train each selected algorithm on the training dataset.
10. Evaluate Models: Use metrics like accuracy to assess the models' performance on the test dataset.
11. Predictions: Make predictions on new data using the trained models.
12. Outcome: A classification model that accurately predicts the species of iris flowers
